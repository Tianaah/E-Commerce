## Overview

### About the Project

The E-commerce Product Page is a highly interactive and responsive single-product page that mimics a real-world e-commerce website. The page includes a visually appealing design and focuses on delivering core functionalities like image galleries, cart management, and responsive layouts.

This project was built to enhance my understanding of front-end development concepts, including responsive design, state management, and user interaction handling.

### Features

Users can:

- **View responsive layouts** that adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Interact with the product gallery**, including a lightbox feature to view larger images.
- **Switch product images** using thumbnail previews.
- **Add and remove items** in the shopping cart.
- **View hover effects** for interactive elements, providing better feedback.

## My Process

### Technologies Used

This project was built using:

- **CSS**: Custom properties, Flexbox, and Grid for layout and styling.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For interactivity, including cart management and the lightbox feature.
- **Mobile-first workflow**: Ensuring the design is accessible on smaller devices before scaling up.

### Approach

1. **Planning & Design**:
   - Studied the challenge requirements from Frontend Mentor.
   - Sketched the layout based on the provided design.
2. **HTML & CSS Setup**:
   - Built the HTML structure with semantic tags.
   - Styled the layout using CSS with a focus on responsiveness.
3. **Adding Interactivity**:
   - Implemented JavaScript to handle:
     - Cart item management.
     - Lightbox image gallery.
     - Thumbnail image switching.
4. **Testing & Debugging**:
   - Tested across various screen sizes.
   - Debugged cross-browser compatibility issues.

### Challenges

- **Implementing the lightbox feature**: Initially, it was challenging to synchronize thumbnail clicks with the main product image display, but a proper understanding of event listeners resolved this.
- **Cart management logic**: Developing logic to add and remove items dynamically without refreshing the page required careful planning and DOM manipulation.

### Key Learnings

This project improved my understanding of:

- **Responsive Design**: I gained confidence in using media queries to build adaptive layouts.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Handling user interactions and dynamically updating the UI.
- **State Management**: Managing the cart and gallery states using JavaScript efficiently.

## Future Improvements

- Add animations for the lightbox and cart interactions.
- Integrate a back-end API to handle real-time cart updates.
- Improve accessibility, ensuring the website is WCAG compliant.
- Add unit tests for JavaScript functionalities to ensure reliability.
